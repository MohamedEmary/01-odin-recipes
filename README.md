# Odin Recipes

A comprehensive collection of Egyptian dishes, presented as a project within The Odin Project web development curriculum.

In this website, I will apply what I have learned in [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com) curriculum so far to create a website that contains a collection of Egyptian dishes.

## So what I have Learned so far?

- Basic **Terminal Commands** from [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) website

- Web basics like **DNS, IP address, Packets, Client and Server**

- Basic **git workflow** and some basic **git commands**.

- How to write good **commit messages** and to use **atomic commits** and **semantic versioning**.

- In HTML I learned about Elements and Tags, HTML Boilerplate, `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, and how to add links, lists, and images in HTML.
