        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Egyptian rice is a very short grain rice, grown in Egypt. It is not cooked the same way as medium or long grain rice. When cooked, it is supposed to have a fluffy texture, not at all sticky.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup 1/2-inch long vermicelli</li>
        <li>1 cup Egyptian rice (short-grain rice)</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add vermicelli; cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour in rice and salt; stir until coated with oil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Cook the rice mixture, stirring constantly, until rice turns pasty white, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
